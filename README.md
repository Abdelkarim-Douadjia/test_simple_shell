### ALX Software Engineering Programme project on building basic Shell :family:

The Linux command line is a text interface to your computer. Often referred to as the shell, terminal, console, prompt or various other names, it can give the appearance of being complex and confusing to use. Yet the ability to copy and paste commands from a website, combined with the power and flexibility the command line offers, means that using it may be essential

This projetc is to put together all what we have learnt so far in C programming language which includes:
- Basics of programming
- Basics of C
- Basics of thinking like an engineer
- Group work
- and Learning how to learn

### Task 1
Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

Your Shell should:

Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
Handle errors.
You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)

### Task 2
Handle command lines with arguments

### Task 3
- Handle the PATH
- fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist

### Task 4
- Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
- Usage: exit
- You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit

### Task 5
- Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
